     - Final Presentation: 1 day
   - **Protocols**:
     - Timelines must be adhered to.
     - Final presentation and code submission before the final day.
     - Attendance in review meetings is mandatory.

2. **Dataset Details (Details of dataset.docx)**:
   - **Attributes**:
     - **Demographics**: `ID`, `Year_Birth`, `Education`, `Marital_Status`, `Income`, `Kidhome`, `Teenhome`, `Dt_Customer`
